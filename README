This is "Bunnies and Lozenges," a proof of concept game using the API of HeartRate Games (http://www.heartrategames.com).  The API is still under construction and not yet released.

Bunnies and Lozenges is intended to be an exercise game.  It uses Unity 3.1.0f4.

The only thing available in this repo for right now are the C# scripts for this project.
